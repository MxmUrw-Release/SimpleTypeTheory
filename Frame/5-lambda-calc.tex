When we restrict the type theory of Agda to only function types, together with
lambda abstraction and application, we get the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus ($\lamto$).
It is also called simple type theory (STT) and was first published by Church in
1940 \citep{CardoneHistory}.

The formalization in this chapter is based on the definitions found in
\citet{IntroTT} and \citet{PittsNotes}.
